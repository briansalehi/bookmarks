# References

A collection of notes from the books I have read and mapped to their corresponding reference manual.  
This is intented to be only for my personal use, but you might be interested in what I read and what I think about the books I have read.

## [Topics](topics/README.md)

Processed notes edited and imported from bookmarks but independent from any resources and intentionally ordered for coding practices.

## [Bookmarks](bookmarks/README.md)

Small pieces of text directly collected from textbooks.  
These notes are resource dependent and are inherently ordered in the specific direction pointed by corresponding books.  
After processed they will be put into topics pages to complement related subjects.
