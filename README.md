# References

A collection of notes from the books I have read and mapped to their corresponding reference manual.  
This is intented to be only for my personal use, but you might be interested in what I read and what I think about the books I have read.

## Topics

These are processed notes edited and imported from bookmarks but independent from any resources and intentionally ordered for coding practices.

* [C++ Programming](topics/cpp.md)
