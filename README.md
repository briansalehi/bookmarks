## Motivation

Resources like books usually discuss about a topic but from a specific point of
view, or partially explains a problem. When summary of all the details from
multiple notes are extracted and connected like pieces of a puzzle, the topic
can be understood better.

## Copy Right

These resources are never extracted by copying a piece of a text from a book or
to use any of the original content and material. Everything you find here is
only manually written as an extraction with a difference from the original.

## Copy Left

Feel free to spread these collections. Note that they will be regularly
updated, an soon will be moved to a database.
