# References

A collection of notes from the books I have read and
mapped to their corresponding reference manual.

## Motivation

This is intented to be only for my personal use,
but you might be interested in what I read and
what I think about the books I have read.

To manage my studies, I slice my progress into
[stages](stages.md). Each stage contains a few
specific topics to be covered by related books.
