<summary>How to run a container from an existing image using docker?</summary>

> This is the command used to start new containers.
> In its simplest form, it accepts an image and a command as arguments.
> The image is used to create the container and the command is the application
> the container will run when it starts.
> This example will start an Ubuntu container in the foreground,
> and tell it to run the Bash shell:
>
> ```sh
> docker container run --interactive --tty ubuntu /bin/bash

>
> The `-it` flags tell Docker to make the container interactive and to attach

<summary>How to exit a container's shell without killing its process in docker?</summary>

> If you’re logged on to the container and type exit, you’ll terminate the

> Press Ctrl-P then Ctrl-Q to exit the container without terminating its main process.

<summary>How does docker use manifests to fetch host compatible image layers when pulling images?</summary>

> Assume you are running Docker on a Raspberry Pi (Linux running on ARM

> exists for the image, it will be parsed to see if an entry exists for Linux
> on ARM. If an ARM entry exists, the manifest for that image is retrieved
> and parsed for the crypto ID’s of the layers that make up the image. Each
> layer is then pulled from DockerHub.

<summary>How to write a Dockerfile for a Linux based image containing a nodejs program?</summary>

> RUN apk add --update nodejs nodejs-npm
> COPY . /src
> WORKDIR /src
> RUN npm install
> EXPOSE 8080
> ENTRYPOINT ["node", "./app.js"]
> ``````
>
> The `RUN` instruction uses the Alpine apk package manager to install node js and nodejs-npm into the image.
> It creates a new image layer directly above the Alpine base layer, and installs the packages in this layer.
> 
> The `COPY . /src` instruction creates another new layer and copies in the
> application and dependency f i les from the build context.
> 
> The `WORKDIR` instruction sets the working directory inside the image filesystem for the rest of the instructions in the file.
> This instruction does not create a new image layer.
> 
> Then the `RUN` npm install instruction creates a new layer and uses `npm` to install application dependencies listed in the `package.json` file in the build context.
> It runs within the context of the `WORKDIR` set in the previous instruction, and installs the dependencies into the newly created layer.
> 
> The application exposes a web service on TCP port 8080, so the Dockerfile documents this with the `EXPOSE 8080` instruction.
> This is added as image metadata and not an image layer.
> 
> Finally, the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction is used to set the main application that the image (container) should run.
> This is also added as metadata and not an image layer.
>
> All non-comment lines are Instructions and take the format `INSTRUCTION argument`.
> Instruction names are not case sensitive, but it’s normal practice to write them in UPPERCASE.
> This makes reading the Docker file easier.
>
> It's important that you understand containers are persistent in nature.
> Containers are designed to be immutable objects and it’s not a good practice to write data to them.
> For this reason, Docker provides volumes that exist separately from the container, but can be mounted into the container at runtime.
