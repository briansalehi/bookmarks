> ```sh

## Chapter 7/16

While this example illustrates the persistent nature of containers, it’s
important you understand two things:

1. The data created in this example is stored on the Docker hosts local filesystem. If the Docker host fails, the data will be lost.
2. Containers are designed to be immutable objects and it’s not a good practice to write data to them.

For these reasons, Docker provides volumes that exist separately from the
container, but can be mounted into the container at runtime.

===

This is a form of self-healing that enables Docker to automatically restart
them after certain events or failures have occurred.

<summary>What are docker restart policies and how can they be applied to containers?</summary>

---

=EE=81=89eRUN apk add --update nodejs nodejs-npminstruction uses the
Alpineapkpa=EE=80=BAage manager to install nodejsandnodejs-npminto the imag=
e. It
creates a new image layer directly above the Alpine base layer, and
installs the pa=EE=80=BAages in this layer.

---

=EE=81=89eCOPY . /srcinstruction creates another new layer and copies in th=
e
application and dependency f i les from the build context.

---

Next, the Do=EE=80=BAerf i le uses theWORKDIRinstruction to set the working
directory inside the image f i lesystem for the rest of the instructions in
the f i le. =EE=81=89is instruction does not create a new image layer.

---

=EE=81=89en theRUNnpminstallinstruction creates a new layer and usesnpmto i=
nstall
application dependencies listed in thepackage.jsonf i le in the build
context. It runs within the context of theWORKDIRset in the previous
instruction, and installs the dependencies into the newly created layer.

---

=EE=81=89e application exposes a web service on TCP port 8080, so the Do=EE=
=80=BAerf i le
documents this with theEXPOSE 8080 instruction. =EE=81=89is is added as ima=
ge
metadata and not an image layer.

---

Finally, theENTRYPOINTinstruction is used to set the main application that
the image (container) should run. =EE=81=89is is also added as metadata and=
 not an
image layer.

---

=EE=81=89e following command will build a new image calledweb:latest. =EE=
=81=89e period (.)
at the end of the command tells Do=EE=80=BAer to use the shell=E2=80=99s cu=
rrent working
directory as the build context.

---

docker image build -t web:latest .

---

docker image ls

---

You can use thedocker image inspect web:latestcommand to verify the conf i
guration of the image. It will list all of the se=EE=80=BCings that were co=
nf i
gured from the Do=EE=80=BAerf i le. Look out for the list of image layers a=
nd the
Entrypointcommand.

---

In order to push an image to Do=EE=80=BAer Hub, you need to login with your=
 Do=EE=80=BAer
ID. You also need to tag the image appropriately.

---

docker login

---

Before you can push an image, you need to tag it in a special way. =EE=81=
=89is is
because Do=EE=80=BAer needs all of the following information when pushing a=
n image:
=E2=80=A2Registry =E2=80=A2Repository =E2=80=A2Tag

---

Do=EE=80=BAer is opinionated, so by default it pushes images to Do=EE=80=BA=
er Hub. You can
push to other registries, but you have to explicitly set the registry URL
as part of thedocker image pushcommand.

---

docker image tag web:latest nigelpoulton/web:latest =EE=81=89e format of th=
e
command isdocker image tag <current-tag> <new-tag>and it adds an additional
tag, it does not overwrite the original.

docker image push nigelpoulton/web:latest

---

=EE=81=89edocker image buildcommand parses the Do=EE=80=BAerf i le one-line=
-at-a-time
starting from the top.

---

Comment lines start with the#=EE=80=BBaracter.

---

All non-comment lines are Instructions and take the formatINSTRUCTION
argument. Instruction names are not case sensitive, but it=E2=80=99s normal
practice to write them in UPPERCASE. =EE=81=89is makes reading the Do=EE=80=
=BAerf i le
easier.

---

Some instructions create new layers, whereas others just add metadata to
the image conf i g f i le.

---

Examples of instructions that create new layers areFROM,RUN, andCOPY.
Examples that create metadata include EXPOSE,WORKDIR,ENV, andENTRYPOINT. =
=EE=81=89e
basic premise is this =E2=80=94 if an instruction is adding content su=EE=
=80=BB as f i les
and programs to the image, it will create a new layer. If it is adding
instructions on how to build the image and run the application, it will
create metadata.

---

You can view the instructions that were used to build the image with
thedocker image history command.
$ docker image history web:latest

---

You can force the build process to ignore the entire ca=EE=80=BBe by passin=
g
the--no-cache=3Dtruef l ag to thedocker image buildcommand.

---

It is also important to understand that theCOPYandADDinstructions include
steps to ensure that the content being copied into the image has not =EE=80=
=BBanged
since the last build. For example, it=E2=80=99s possible that theCOPY . /sr=
c
instruction in the Do=EE=80=BAerf i le has not =EE=80=BBanged since the pre=
vious, but=E2=80=A6 the
contents of the directory being copied into the image have =EE=80=BBanged!
To protect against this, Do=EE=80=BAer performs a =EE=80=BBe=EE=80=BAsum ag=
ainst ea=EE=80=BB f i le being
copied, and compares that to a =EE=80=BBe=EE=80=BAsum of the same f i le in=
 the ca=EE=80=BBed
layer. If the =EE=80=BBe=EE=80=BAsums do not mat=EE=80=BB, the ca=EE=80=BBe=
 is invalidated and a new layer
is built.

---

Add the--squashf l ag to thedocker image buildcommand if you want to create
a squashed image.

---

If you are building Linux images, and using the apt pa=EE=80=BAage manager,=
 you
should use theno-install-recommends f l ag with theapt-get installcommand.
=EE=81=89is makes sure thataptonly installs main dependencies (pa=EE=80=BAa=
ges in
theDependsf i eld) and not recommended or suggested pa=EE=80=BAages.

---

Containerizing an app - The commands =E2=80=A2docker image buildis the comm=
and that
reads a Do=EE=80=BAerf i le and containerizes an application. =EE=81=89e-tf=
 l ag tags the
image, and the-ff l ag lets you specify the name and location of the Do=EE=
=80=BAerf
i le. With the-ff l ag, it is possible to use a Do=EE=80=BAerf i le with an
arbitrary name and in an arbitrary location. =EE=81=89e build context is wh=
ere your

=80=BAer
host or a remote Git repo.
=E2=80=A2 =EE=81=89eFROMinstruction in a Do=EE=80=BAerf i le specif i es th=
e base image for the new
image you will build. It is usually the f i rst instruction in a Do=EE=80=
=BAerf i
le and a best-practice is to use images from of f i cial repos on this line=
.
=E2=80=A2 =EE=81=89eRUNinstruction in a Do=EE=80=BAerf i le allows you to run commands inside the
image. Ea=EE=80=BBRUNinstruction creates a single new layer.
=E2=80=A2 =EE=81=89eCOPYinstruction in a Do=EE=80=BAerf i le adds f i les i=
nto the image as a new
layer. It is common to use theCOPY instruction to copy your application
