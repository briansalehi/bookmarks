<summary>What are the two properties of linear transformation functions?</summary>

> A linear transformation is a function T: Rⁿ → Rⁿ that satisfies the following two properties:
- T(v+w) = T(v) + T(w) for all vectors v,w ∈ Rⁿ
- T(cv) = cT(v) for all vectors v ∈ Rⁿ and all scalars c ∈ R
</details>

<summary>Determine whether or not function T(v1, v2) = (1+v1, 2+v2) when T: R² → R² is a linear transformation?</summary>

> This transformation is **not** linear.
> One way to see this is to notice that 2T(0,0) = 2(1,2) = (2,4)
> But T(2(0,0)) = T(0,0) = (1,2)
> Since these are not the same, T is not linear.

<summary>Determine whether or not function T(v1, v2) = (v1-v2, v1v2) when T: R² → R² is a linear transformation?</summary>

> This transformation is **not** linear.
> One way to see this is to notice that 2T(1,1) = 2(0,1) = (0,2)
> But T(2(1,1)) = T(2,2) = (0,4)
> Since these are not the same, T is not linear.

<summary>Determine whether or not function T(v1, v2) = (v1-v2, v1+v2) when T: R² → R² is a linear transformation?</summary>

> This transformation **is** linear.
> We can check the two defining properties of linear transformations.

<summary>Using the fact that linear transformation functions preserve linear combinations, write linear transformation T(v) as linear combination of its basis vectors when T: Rⁿ → Rⁿ?</summary>

> T(c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + … + ckvk) = c₁T(v₁) + c₂T(v₂) + … + ckT(vk)
> for all v₁,v₂,…,vk ∈ Rⁿ and all c₁,c₂,…,ck ∈ R
>
> So we have:
> T(v) = T(v₁e₁+v₂e₂+…+vnen) = v₁T(e₁)+v₂T(e₂)+…+vnT(en)

<summary>Suppose T: R² → R² is a linear transformation for which we have its standard basis vector transformations T(e₁) = (1,1) and T(e₂) = (-1,1). Compute T(2,3) and find a general formula for T(v₁,v₂).</summary>

> If we know what T does to the standard basis vectors, then we know everything about T.
>
> Since (2,3) = 2e₁+3e₂, we know that:
> T(2,3) = T(2e₁+3e₂) = 2T(e₁)+3T(e₂) = 2(1,1) + 3(-1,1) = (-1,5)
>
> We can also find the formula for this linear transformation as follows:
> T(v₁,v₂) = T(v₁e₁+v₂e₂) = v₁T(e₁)+v₂T(e₂) = v₁(1,1)+v₂(-1,1) = (v₁-v₂,v₁+v₂)
