<summary>What are the two properties of linear transformation functions?</summary>

> A linear transformation is a function $T: Rⁿ → Rⁿ$ that satisfies the following two properties:
>
> ```math
> T(v+w) = T(v) + T(w) for all vectors v,w ∈ Rⁿ
> T(cv) = cT(v) for all vectors v ∈ Rⁿ and all scalars c ∈ R

<summary>Determine whether or not function $T(v1, v2) = (1+v1, 2+v2)$ when $T: R² → R²$ is a linear transformation?</summary>

> This transformation is **not** linear.
> One way to see this is to notice that $2T(0,0) = 2(1,2) = (2,4)$
> But $T(2(0,0)) = T(0,0) = (1,2)$
> Since these are not the same, $T$ is not linear.

<summary>Find the standard matrices of the linear transformations that project onto the lines in the direction of vector w = (1,2,3) ∈ R³?</summary>

> Since w is not a unit vector, we have to first normalize it:
> ∥w∥ = √1²+2²+3² = √14
> u = w/∥w∥ = (1,2,3)/√14
> [Pu] = uuT = 1/√14 [(1,2,3)]\[1 2 3] = 1/14 [(1,2,3) (2,4,6) (3,6,9)]
> This linear transformation squishes all of R³ down onto the line in the direction of w.
> So [Pu]w = w in this example.
