> The best resource to know about sudo in depth.

## Chapter 1/13

<details>
<summary>What are the sudo proprietary alternatives on Unix systems?</summary>

* OpenSolaris-based systems have `pfexec` and role-based access control.
* HP has `pbrun`.
* `sudo` on other Unix systems.
</details>

* [sudo](https://sudo.wd)

<details>
<summary>What version of sudo should be installed on a server at least?</summary>

> v1.8.8 is the least version.
> Older than that need to immediately be upgraded by source or prebuilt packages.
</details>

## Chapter 2/13

<details>
<summary>How to run a command with root privileges using <code>sudo</code>?</summary>

```sh
sudo command
```
</details>

* [sudo(1)](https://manpages.org/sudo/1)

<details>
<summary>How to run a command on behalf of a specific user with sudo?</summary>

```sh
sudo -u user command
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to run a command on behalf of a specific group with sudo?</summary>

> When group ID is desired, put a escaped hash mark before the GID, unless you're on `tcsh` shell.

```sh
sudo -g group command
sudo -g \#gid command
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where are the sudo rules stored on system and how can it be editted properly?</summary>

> sudo rules are in `/etc/sudoers` but should never be editted by hand.
> `visudo` should always be used to change sudo rules.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the general form of each line of sudo rules and what is the definition and scope of each part?</summary>

> `username` might also be a system group, or an alias defined within sudoers.
> `host` is the hostname of the system that this rule applies to when sudoers file is shared across multiple systems.
> `command` lists the full path to each command this rule applies to.
> `ALL` matches every possible option for each of these parts.

```conf
username host = command
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is it best practice to specify a specific <code>hostname</code> rather than <code>ALL</code> in sudo rules?</summary>

> Most commonly ALL is ste as `host` because most system administrators configure sudo on per-host basis.
> Separately managing every server and defining the server as `ALL` means "this server", but it's best practice to put the server name as `host`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to specify multiple options on each sudo rule?</summary>

```sh
sofia,nora,lucy ubuntu = /user/bin/mount, /usr/bin/umount
```

> Users `sofia`, `nora`, and `lucy` can run `mount` and `umount` commands on the server `ubuntu`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to specify commands to run by a specific user on behalf some other user except root in sudo rules?</summary>

> Some applications must run by specific users to work correctly.
> A user other than `root` can be specified in parenthesis, if sudo policy permits it.

```sh
emma debian = (oracle) ALL
```

> User `emma` can run any commands on the server `debian`, but only as the user `oracle`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can sudo rules be specified multiple times for users on different hosts and commands?</summary>

> Yes, separate rules on each line, but separate users, hosts and commands by comman on one line as much as possible.

```cpp
elena www = (oracle) ALL
elena www = /usr/bin/mount, /usr/bin/umount
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to break long rules into multiple lines?</summary>

> End a line with a backslash to continue rules on the next line.

```sh
emma,elena,sofia www,dns,mail = /usr/bin/mount, /usr/bin/umount, \
    /usr/bin/fdisk
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>What rules match in sudo when multiple rules exist in sudoers file?</summary>

> Last matching rule wins.
> If two rules conflict, the last matching rule wins.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to use negate operator to exclude one item from a list in sudoers file?</summary>

> Negation operator `!` can be used to apply to everything except a specific user, host ro command.
> Negation operator `!` can also be used to turn off options.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What must be written in the last line of sudoers file to be accepted by visudo?</summary>

> Last sudoers line must be an empty line, otherwise visudo comlains it.
</details>

## Chapter 3/13

<details>
<summary>What editor does the <code>visudo</code> use to edit <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

> Default editor for `visudo` is `vi` which is in most of the systems are linked to `vim`.

```sh
export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim
visudo
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to keep editing <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file after making a syntactical error in <code>visudo</code> and save it?</summary>

> `visudo` asks user to edit file again by pressing `e` and go back into file before overwriting <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file happens.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to retain older <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file after attempting to save incorrect changes by <code>visudo</code>?</summary>

> `visudo` asks user to press `x` and remove recent changes and then retain old policies.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to put an emergency rescue rule in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file by <code>visudo</code> in case every other access rules failed?</summary>

> The last matching rule wins, so the last rule is strongly recommended to give your account the right to run <code>visudo</code>.

```sh
brian ALL = /usr/bin/visudo
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to tell what a user can access with <code>sudo</code>?</summary>

> Only <code>root</code> and <code>users</code> that can run <code>ALL</code> commands on the current host can use <code>-U</code>.

```sh
sudo -l
```
</details>

## Chapter 4/13

<details>
<summary>What mechanism is used in <code>sudo</code> rules to simplify overwhelmingly repeated rules and similar possible options?</summary>

> Lists and aliases simplify repetition of rule items using wildcards.  
> Wildcards can be used to match hosts, filesystem paths, and command-line arguments.

```sh
sofia dns? = ALL
elena mail[1-4] = ALL
claire www[a-z]* = ALL
pete ALL = /usr/sbin/*, /usr/local/sbin/*
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can asterisk become harmful when used in different parts of rules like command arguments?</summary>

> Asterisk matches everything and can give users the possibility of adding multiple arguments and breaking the responsibility chain of commands.

```sh
evil ALL = /usr/bin/cat /var/log/messages*
```

> This can be extended like below, which is definitely not intended:

```sh
sudo cat /var/log/messages /etc/passwd /etc/sudoers
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How wildcards can be carefully used to not expose accessibility to users?</summary>

> Use limited wildcards to match specific characters, like using `[0-9]` instead of `*`.

```sh
alisa ALL = /usr/bin/tail -f /var/log/messages, /usr/bin/tail -f /var/log/messages??
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to match for specific option characters of a command in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file using wildcards?</summary>

```sh
rosa ALL = /usr/bin/ss -[tuSlnp]
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to authorize a user using a command only without arguments in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

> Two double quotes with no space between them tell sudoers to only match the empty string.

```sh
sara ALL = /usr/bin/dmesg ""
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to use aliases in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file to create a named list of similar items?</summary>

> You can use aliases to refer to the user running the command, the hosts sudo is run on, the user the command is run as, or the commands being run.

> Alias names can only include capital letters, numbers, and underscores.
> The name must begin with a capital letter.

> You must define aliases before using them.

```sh
Cmnd_Alias NETWORK = /usr/bin/ip, /usr/bin/ss
User_Alias DEVOPS = tatiana, alisa, christina
DEVOPS ALL = NETWORK
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>What types of users does the <code>sudo</code> recognize in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

1. **Operating System Groups:** group names start with percent sign `%` in front of them.
2. **User ID**: You can use user ID numbers in sudoers by putting a hash mark `#` before them.
3. **Group ID:** If you don't want to use group names, use GID numbers prefaced by `%#`.
4. **NetGroup:** Stop using NIS, but in case you had to use it, put a plus sign `+` in front of the user names.
5. **Non-Unix Group:** If sudo has necessary plugins to use user management sources beyond Unix systems, preface users with `:`. Users can be enclosed with double quotes.
6. **Non-Unix Group ID:** Similar to previous but preface groups with `%:#`.
7. **User Alias:** List of system users can be aliased together and be named.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to specify an operating system group in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

> **Operating System Groups:** group names start with percent sign `%` in front of them.

```sh
%dba db1 = (oracle) /opt/oracle/bin/*
```

> Everyone in the `dba` group can run all the commands in the directory `/opt/oracle/bin`, as `oracle`, on the server `db1`.

> Some operating systems have a system group for users who can become `root`, like `admin` on Ubuntu, and who may use the root password, like `wheel` on BSD-based systems.

> members of `wheel` can already use `su` to become `root`.
> But this lets people acclimate to using sudo in their day to day work.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to specify users of <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file with <code>UID</code>?</summary>

> **User ID:** You can use user ID numbers in sudoers by putting a hash mark `#` before them.

```sh
#1000 ALL = /usr/bin/reboot
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to specify members of a group in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> using their GID?</summary>

> **Group ID:** If you don't want to use group names, use GID numbers prefaced by `%#`.

> On a traditional BSD system, `wheel` is group 0.

```sh
%#0 ALL = ALL
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to list usernames with aliases in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

> A user alias is a list of system users.

> All user alias definitions start with `User_Alias`.

```sh
User_Alias SYSADMINS = rosa
User_Alias MONITORING = alice, christiana
```

> Any type of usernames can be speicified in user aliases.

```sh
User_Alias #1000, %#1000, %devops
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does <code>sudo</code> determines the hostname on a system?</summary>

> Sudo determines the name of the local host by running hostname.
> It does not rely on DNS, /etc/hosts, LDAP, or any other name directory.

> This means that your hostnames in sudoers must match the hostname set on the local machine.
> Change the hostname and sudo breaks.

```sh
hostname
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How many forms the host can be specified in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

* Host names
* IP addresses

```sh
peter www = ALL
mike 192.0.2.1 = ALL
hank 192.0.2.0/24 = ALL
jake 198.42.100.0/255.255.255.0 = ALL
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How hosts can be aliased in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

```sh
Host_Alias DMZ = 192.0.2.0/24, 192.42.100.0/255.255.255.0, www
lucy DMZ = all
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to specify a list of run-as users in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

> All types of usernames can also be applied to run-as user list.

```sh
christina db[0-9] = (oracle,postgres,mysql) ALL
rachel ALL = (%devops,%dbms) ALL
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to specify run-as aliases in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

```sh
Runas_Alias DBMS = oracle, postgres, mysql
rachel db[0-9] = (DBMS) ALL
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to create a list of command in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

```sh
kate ALL = /usr/bin/ip, /usr/bin/ss, /usr/bin/wpa_supplicant
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to specify a command alias in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

```sh
Cmnd_Alias NETWORK = /usr/bin/ip, /usr/bin/ss, /usr/bin/wpa_supplicant
kate ALL = NETWORK
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>What the command tags are and how they can be speicified in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

> A tag appears before the command list, separated from the commands by a colon.
> Tag names are all capitals, without any numbers or symbols.
> A tag affects all the commands in the list following the tag.

```sh
karen ALL = NOEXEC: ALL
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can lists be negated in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

> **DO NOT USE NEGATION IN COMMAND LIST AND ALIASES!**

```sh
User_Alias ADMINS = %wheel, !kate
ADMINS ALL = ALL
```

> The members of group wheel, with one exception, get full access to the system.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is it dangerious to use negation in a command list and alias?</summary>

> Excluding commands is a bad idea. There is no way to exclude all insecure commands.

```conf
Cmnd_Alias BECOME_ROOT = /usr/bin/sh, /usr/bin/bash, /usr/bin/su
%wheel ALL = ALL, !BECOME_ROOT
```

```sh
cp /usr/bin/bash /tmp/bash
sudo /tmp/bash
id
```

* integer
* list of integers
* string
</details>

<details>
<summary>How boolean options can be enabled or disabled in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

```sh
Defaults option = number
Defaults option = 0
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How string options can be used in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>

```sh
Defaults option = "value with special characters!"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How list options can be written in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file?</summary>
