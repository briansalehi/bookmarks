> The cloning process can be trimmed by setting `--depth 1` option.

<summary>What assumptions and flags are enabled by <code>kbuild</code> infrastructure based on the target architecture?</summary>

> Cross-compiler prefix and the architecture of the target must be specified.

> When `ARCH` is omitted or not set, it will default to the host where `make` is executed. It will default to `$(uname -m)`.  
> When `CROSS_COMPILE` is omitted or not set, `$(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc` will result in `gcc`, and will be the same for other tools, for example `$(CROSS_COMPILE)ld` will result in `ld`.

<summary>How many module types are available?</summary>

<summary>What are the <code>__init</code> and <code>__exit</code> function prefixes in kernel modules?</summary>

> `__init` and `__exit` are kernel macros, defined in `include/linux/init.h`.  
> They are Linux directives (macros) that wrap GNU C compiler attributes used for symbol placement.  
> They instruct the compiler to put the code they prefix in the `.init.text` and `.exit.text` sections.
>
> ```c
> #define __init __section(.init.text)
> #define __exit __section(.exit.text)
> ``````
>
> `__init`:
>
> The `__init` keyword tells the linker to place the symbols (variables or functions)
> they prefix in a dedicated section in the resulting kernel object file.
> This section is known in advance to the kernel and freed when the module is loaded
> and the initialization function has finished.
> This applies only to built-in modules, not to loadable ones.
> Since the driver cannot be unloaded, its initialization function will never be called
> again until the next reboot.
> There is no need to keep references on this initialization function anymore.
>
> `__exit`:
>
> It is the same for the `__exit` keyword and the exit method, whose corresponding code
> is omitted when the module is compiled statically into the kernel or when module
> unloading support is not enabled because, in both cases, the exit function

<summary>What are the differences of <code>EXPORT_SYMBOL</code> and <code>EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL</code> macros exporting symbols based on license?</summary>

> The license will define how your source code should be shared (or not) with other developers.
> `MODULE_LICENSE()` tells the kernel what license our module is under.
> It has an effect on your module behavior, since a license that is not compatible with
> **GPL (General Public License)** will result in your module not being able to see/use
> symbols exported by the kernel through the `EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()` macro,
> which shows the symbols for GPL-compatible modules only.
> This is the opposite of `EXPORT_SYMBOL()`, which exports functions for modules with any license.
>
> Loading a non-GPL-compatible module will result in a tainted kernel; that means non-open source or untrusted code has been loaded, and you will likely have no support from the community.
>
> Remember that the module without `MODULE_LICENSE()` is not considered open source and will taint the kernel too.
> Available licenses can be found in `include/linux/module.h`, describing the license supported by the kernel.
