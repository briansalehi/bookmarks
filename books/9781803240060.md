<summary>How to download the Linux kernel for building?</summary>

> Linux source can be cloned as follows:
>
> ```sh
> git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
> ``````
>
> The cloning process can be trimmed by setting `--depth 1` option.

<summary>How to generate the preconfigured <code>.config</code> file rather than making it from scratch?</summary>

> The selected options will be stored in a `.config` file, at the root of the source tree.
> It is very difficult to know which configuration is going to work on your platform.
> In most cases, there will be no need to start a configuration from scratch.
> There are default and functional configuration files available in each arch directory that you can use as a starting point (it is important to start with a configuration that already works):
>
> ```sh
> ls arch/<your_arch>/configs/
> ``````
>
> The kernel configuration command, given a default configuration file, is as follows:

> ```sh
> make <foo_defconfig>

<details>
<summary>How to revert configuration changes in kernel source tree after generating new <code>.config</code> file?</summary>

> Running `make defconfig` or any alternatives will generate a new `.config` file in the main (root) directory, while the old `.config` will be renamed `.config.old`.

<details>
<summary>How to create a new default configuration target in kernel source tree?</summary>

> ```sh
> make savedefconfig
> ``````
>
> This command will create a minimal (since it won't store non-default settings) configuration file.
> The generated default configuration file will be called defconfig and stored at the root of the source tree.
> You can store it in another location using the following command:
>
> ```sh
> mv defconfig arch/<arch>/configs/myown_defconfig
> ``````
>
> This way, you can share a reference configuration inside the kernel sources and other developers can now get the same `.config` file as you by running the following command:
>
> ```sh
> make myown_defconfig

<summary>How to switch from an old kernel configuration into a new one?</summary>

<summary>Where is the kernel configuration file in a running machine to use as an initial configurtion?</summary>

> Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions save the `.config` file in the `/boot` directory:

> ``````
>
> The other distributions may not do this.
>
> When `IKCONFIG` and `IKCONFIG_PROC` kernel configuration options enabled, the configuration file can also be found in:

<summary>What kernel configuration option makes the kernel symbol table available in <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>?</summary>

> `CONFIG_KALLSYMS`: This is very useful for tracers and other tools that need to map kernel symbols to addresses. It is used while you're printing oops messages. Without this, oops listings would produce hexadecimal output, which is difficult to interpret.

<summary>How to install the kernel binary file on native and non-native targets?</summary>

<summary>What artifacts does <code>make modules_install</code> command generate on the host machine?</summary>

> Module files are installed in `/lib/modules/<version>`:
>
> * `modules.builtin`: This lists all the kernel objects (.ko) that are built into the kernel. It is used by the module loading utility (modprobe, for example) so that it does not fail when it's trying to load something that's already built in. `modules.builtin.bin` is its binary counterpart.
> * `modules.alias`: This contains the aliases for module loading utilities, which are used to match drivers and devices.
> * `modules.dep`: This lists modules, along with their dependencies. `modules.dep.bin` is its binary counterpart.
> * `modules.symbols`: This tells us which module a given symbol belongs to. They are in the form of `alias symbol:<symbol> <modulename>`. An example is `alias symbol:v4l2_async_notifier_register videodev`. `modules.symbols.bin` is the binary counterpart of this file.
