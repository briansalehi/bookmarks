<summary>How does <code>eBPF</code> help us to learn application behavior?</summary>

> With `eBPF` we can add instrumentation into the kernel to observe application interactions with the kernel and intercept what would be involved if we wanted to modify the kernel, adding new code to create some kind of output whenever that system call is invoked.

<summary>What does the <code>eBPF</code> verifier?</summary>

> The `eBPF` verifier, which ensures that an eBPF program is loaded only if it’s safe to run—it won’t crash the machine or lock it up in a hard loop, and it won’t allow data to be compromised.

<summary>What is the advantage of dynamic loading functionality in <code>eBPF</code>?</summary>

> `eBPF` programs can be loaded into and removed from the kernel dynamically.
> Once they are attached to an event, they’ll be triggered by that event regardless of what caused that event to occur.
> This is a huge advantage compared to upgrading the kernel and then having to reboot the machine to use its new functionality.

<summary>How efficient is loading eBPF programs?</summary>

> Once loaded and JIT-compiled, the program runs as native machine instructions on the CPU.
> Additionally, there’s no need to incur the cost of transitioning between kernel and user space (which is an expensive operation) to handle each event.
