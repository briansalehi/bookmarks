<summary>How do we measure the speed of an operation in code?</summary>

<summary>How many steps does each of four main operations take for an array?</summary>

> **Read:** Computers read an array in just one step.
>
> **Search:** To Search for a value within an array, computers have no choice but to inspect each cell one at a time.
> This algorithm is called **linear search**.
>
> **Insert:** Inserting data in an array can take N+1 steps for an array containing N elements.
> This is because in the worst case scenario we need to shift all N elements over, and then finally execute the insertion step.
>
> **Delete:** For an array containing N elements, the maximum number of steps that deletion would take is N steps.
> This is because we need one deletion and N-1 shifts.

<summary>What's the difference between an array-based set and an array?</summary>

> The only difference between array-based set and an array is that the set never allows duplicate values to be inserted into it.

<summary>How many steps does each of four main operations take for an array-based set?</summary>

> **Reading:** Reading from an array-based set is exactly as reading from an array, it takes just one step for a computer to look up what's contained within a particular index.
>
> **Search:** Searching an array-based set also turns out to be no different than searching an array, it takes up to N steps to search for a value within an array-based set.
>
> **Delete:** Deletion is also identical between an array-based set and an array.
> In the worst case scenario, it takes N steps to delete a value within an array-based set.
>
> **Insert:** Insertion, however is different between arrays and array-based set.
> With an array it takes N shifts and one insertion step.
> With an array-based set however, every insertion first requires a search to check for existence of a duplicate.
> Insertion into the end of an array-based set will take up to N steps to search and one step for the actual insertion, which takes N+1 steps in total.
> In the worst case scenario, inserting a value at the beginning of an array-based set takes N steps to look up for duplicates,
> and N steps to shift all the data to the right, and one last final step to insert the new value.
> That's total of 2N+1 steps.

<details>
<summary>how many steps does each of four main operations take for an ordered array?</summary>

> **Read:** Same as array and array-based set.
>
> **Delete:** Same as array and array-based set.
>
> **Insert:** In terms of N, it takes N elements in an ordered array, the insertion takes N+2 steps in total, no matter where in the ordered array the new value ends up.
> If the value ends up toward the beginning of the ordered array, we have fewer comparisons and more shifts.
> If the value ends up toward the end, we get more comparisons but fewer shifts.
>
> **Search:** Searching can be applied to ordered array using different algorithms.
> Using **linear search** algorithm, the operation can be stopped early when the value is found.
> Using **binary search** algorithm, it would take only one more step to search each time data set grows twice.

<summary>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using ordered array over unordered array?</summary>

> Within an ordered array, we can stop a **linear search** early even if the value isn't contained within the array as soon as we reach a value with a higher order.
>
> *pseudocode for C++*
> ```cpp
> iterator linear_search(array, search_value)
> {
>     for (iter = array.begin(); iter != array.end() && *iter >= search_value; ++*iter)
>         if (*iter == search_value)
>             return iter;
>     return nullptr;
> }
> ``````
>
> Though, using an ordered array we can also use **binary search** to attempt a search much faster!
>
> ```cpp
> iterator binary_search(array, search_value)
> {
>     lower_bound = array.begin();
>     upper_bound = array.end() - 1;
> 
>     while (lower_bound <= upper_bound)
>     {
>         midpoint = (upper_bound + lower_bound) / 2;
>         midpoint_value = array[midpoint];
> 
>         if (search_value == midpoint_value)
>             return midpoiont;
>         else if (search_value > midpoint_value)
>             upper_bound = midpoint - 1;
>         else if (search_value < midpoint_value)
>             lower_bound = midpoint + 1;
>     }
> 
>     return nullptr;
> }
