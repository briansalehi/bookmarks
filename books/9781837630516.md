<summary>How to installing the EPEL repository on the CentOS and AlmaLinux virtual machines?</summary>

> While the **Ubuntu** package repositories have pretty much everything that you need, the **CentOS** and **AlmaLinux** package repositories are lacking.
> You’ll need to install the EPEL repository. (The EPEL project is run by the Fedora team.)  
> When you install third-party repositories on Red Hat 7 and CentOS 7 systems, you’ll also need to install a priorities package and edit the `.repo` files to set the proper priorities for each repository.
> This will prevent packages from the third-party repository from overwriting official Red Hat and CentOS packages if they just happen to have the same name.  
> The two packages that you’ll need to install EPEL are in the normal CentOS 7 repositories.
>
> ```sh
> sudo yum install yum-plugin-priorities epel-release
> ``````
>
> When the installation completes, navigate to the `/etc/yum.repos.d` directory, and open the `CentOS-Base.repo` file in your favorite text editor.  
> After the last line of the `base`, `updates`, and extras sections, add the line `priority=1`.  
> After the last line of the `centosplus` section, add the line `priority=2`.  
> Open the `epel.repo` file for editing.
> After the last line of the `epel` section, add the line `priority=10`.
> After the last line of each remaining section, add the line `priority=11`.  
> Update the system and then create a list of the installed and available packages:
>
> ```sh
> sudo yum upgrade sudo yum list > yum_list.txt
> ``````
>
> To install the EPEL repository on **AlmaLinux**, all you have to do is run this command:
>
> ```sh
> sudo dnf install epel-release
> ``````
>
> There’s no priorities package as there is on CentOS 7 and earlier, so we won’t have to worry about configuring the repository priorities.
> When the package installation is complete, update the system and create a list of available sof t ware packages with these two commands:
>
> ```sh
> sudo dnf upgrade sudo dnf list > dnf_list.txt

> By default, Ubuntu systems don’t automatically reboot after an update is installed.
> If you keep it that way, you’ll see a message about it when you log into the system. 
> But if you prefer, you can set Ubuntu to automatically reboot after it automatically updates itself.

>
> ```sh
> Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot "false";

> 8. To manually install the security-related updates without installing non-security updates, just run:
>
> ```sh
> sudo unattended-upgrade -d

>
> ```sh
> sudo dnf upgrade
> ``````
>
> The main functional difference between `yum` and `dnf` is that `dnf` has a different automatic update mechanism.
> Instead of installing the `yum-cron` package, you’ll now install the `dnf-automatic` package:
>
> ```sh
> sudo dnf install dnf-automatic
> ``````
>
> Configure the `/etc/dnf directory/automatic.conf` file the same way as you did the yum-cron.conf file for CentOS 7.  
>
> Instead of working as a cron job, as the old `yum-cron` did, `dnf-automatic` works with a systemd timer.
> When you first install `dnf-automatic`, the timer is disabled.
> Enable it and start it by running this command:
>
> ```sh
> sudo systemctl enable --now dnf-automatic.timer
> ``````
>
> To determine if a system needs to be restarted, just install the `yum-utils` package and run the `needs-restarting` command, the same as you did for CentOS 7.
> (For some reason, the Red Hat developers never bothered to change the package name to `dnf-utils`.)

Setting and enforcing password and account expiration

*****

With the chage utility, you can either set password and account expiration data for other users or use the -l option to view expiration data. Any unprivileged user can use chage -l without sudo to view his or her own data. To either set data or view someone else’s data, you need sudo. We’ll take a closer look at chage a bit later.

*****

let’s fi rst look at where the default settings are stored. 
We’ll fi rst look at the /etc/login.defs fi le. Here are the three relevant lines:
PASS_MAX_DAYS 99999 PASS_MIN_DAYS 0 PASS_WARN_AGE 7

*****

Configuring default expiry data for useradd for Red Hat-type systems only

*****

The /etc/default/useradd fi le has the rest of the default settings.

*****

Ubuntu also has the useradd conf i guration fi le, but it doesn’t work. No matter how you conf i gure it, the Ubuntu version of useradd just won’t read it. So, the write-up about this fi le only applies to Red Hat-type systems.

*****

The EXPIRE= line sets the default expira

tion date for new user accounts. By default, there is no default expiration date. INACTIVE=-1 means that user accounts won’t be automatically locked out af t er the users’ passwords expire. If we set this to a positive number, then any new users will have that many days to change an expired password before the account gets locked.

*****

To change the defaults in the useradd fi le, you can either hand-edit the fi le or use useradd -D with the appropriate option switch for the item that you want to change. For example, to set a default expiration date of December 31, 2025, the command would be as follows:
sudo useradd -D -e 2025-12-31

*****

To see the new conf i guration, you can either open the useradd fi le or just do sudo useradd -D:

*****

useradd doesn’t do any safety checks to ensure that the default shell that you’ve assigned is installed on the system.

*****

Setting expiry data on a per-account basis with useradd and usermod

*****

you’ll want to set account expiry data on a per-account basis, depending on whether you know that the accounts will no longer be needed as of a specif i c date. There are three ways that you can do this:
• Use useradd with the appropriate option switches to set expiry data as you create the accounts. 
(If you need to create a whole bunch of accounts at once with the same expiry data, you can automate the process with a shell script.) • Use usermod to modify expiry data on existing accounts. (The beautiful thing about usermod is that it uses the same option switches as useradd.) • Use chage to modify expiry data on existing accounts. (This one uses a whole dif f erent set of option switches.)

*****

You can use useradd and usermod to set account expiry data, but not to set password expiry data. The only two option switches that af f ect account expiry data are as follows:
• -e: Use this to set an expiration date for the account, in the form YYYY-MM-DD.
• -f: Use this to set the number of days af t er the user’s password expires that you want for his or her account to get locked out.

*****

Let’s say that you want to create an account for Charlie that will expire at the end of 2025. On a Red Hat-type machine, you could enter this:

*****

sudo useradd -e 2025-12-31 charlie

*****

On a non-Red Hat-type machine, you’d have to add the option switches that create the home directory and assign the correct default shell:
sudo useradd -m -d /home/charlie -s /bin/bash -e 2025-12-31 charlie

*****

Use chage -l to verify what you’ve entered:
donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$ sudo chage -l charlie

*****

Now, let’s say that Charlie’s contract has been extended, and you need to change his account expiration to the end of January 2026. You’ll use usermod the same way on any Linux distro:
sudo usermod -e 2026-01-31 charlie

*****

Optionally, you can set the number of days before an account with an expired password will get locked out:
sudo usermod -f 5 charlie But if you were to do that now, you wouldn’t see any dif f erence in the chage -l output because we still haven’t set expiration data for Charlie’s password.

*****

Setting expiry data on a per-account basis with chage

*****

You will only use chage to modify existing accounts, and you will use it for setting either an account expiration or a password expiration. Here are the relevant option switches:

*****

Option Explanation -d If you use the -d 0 option on someone’s account, you’ll force the user to change his or her password on their next login.
-E This is equivalent to the lowercase -e for useradd or usermod. It sets the expiration date for the user account.
-I This is equivalent to -f for useradd or usermod. It sets the number of days before an account with an expired password will be locked out.
-m This sets the minimum number of days between password changes. In other words, if Charlie changes his password today, the -m 5 option will force him to wait fi ve days before he can change his password again.
-M This sets the maximum number of days before a password expires. (Be aware, though, that if Charlie last set his password 89 da

Brian Salehi, [5/3/23 10:18 AM]
ys ago, using a -m 90 option on his account will cause his password to expire tomorrow, not 90 days from now.) -W This will set the number of warning days for passwords that are about to expire.

*****

sudo chage -E 2026-02-28 -I 4 -m 3 -M 90 -W 4 charlie

*****

let’s say that you’ve just created a new account for Samson, and you want to force him to change his password the fi rst time he logs in. There are two ways to do that.

*****

sudo chage -d 0 samson

*****

sudo passwd -e samson

*****

Preventing brute-force password attacks

*****

Setting the lockout value to something more realistic, such as 100 failed login attempts, will still pro-vide good security, while still giving you enough time to gather information about the attackers.

*****

On RHEL 7-type systems and Ubuntu 18.04, you’ll do this by conf i gur-ing the pam_tally2 PAM. On RHEL 8/9-type systems and Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, you’ll instead conf i gure the pam_faillock PAM module.

*****

Configuring the pam_tally2 PAM module on CentOS 7

*****

The pam_tally2 module comes already installed on CentOS 7, but it isn’t conf i gured. We’ll begin by editing the /etc/pam.d/login fi le.

*****

If you’re working with a text-mode server, you’ll only need to conf i gure the /etc/pam.d/ login fi le. But if you’re working with a machine that’s running a graphical desktop envi-ronment, you’ll also need to conf i gure the /etc/pam.d/password.auth and /etc/pam.d/ system.auth fi les.

*****

In the second line of the example, we see that pam_tally2 is set with the following parameters:

*****

• deny=4: This means that the user account under attack will get locked out af t er only four failed login attempts.
• even_deny_root: This means that even the root user account will get locked if it’s under attack.
• unlock_time=1200: The account will get automatically unlocked af t er 1,200 seconds, or 20 minutes.

*****

Once you’ve conf i gured the login fi le and have had a failed login, you’ll see a new fi le created in the /var/log directory. You’ll view information from that fi le with the pam_tally2 utility. You can also use pam_tally2 to manually unlock a locked account if you don’t want to wait for the timeout period:
donnie@centos7:~$ sudo pam_tally2

*****

sudo pam_tally2 --user=charlie --reset

*****

sudo pam_tally2

*****

Conf i guring pam_tally2 is super easy because it only requires adding one line to the /etc/pam.d/ login, /etc/pam.d/password.auth, and /etc/pam.d/system.auth fi les. To make things even easier, you can just copy and paste that line from the example on the pam_tally2 man page.

*****

On the CentOS 7 virtual machine, open the /etc/pam.d/login fi le for editing. Look for the line that invokes the pam_securetty module. (That should be around line 2.) Beneath that line, insert this line:
auth required pam_tally2.so deny=4 even_deny_root unlock_time=1200

*****

Place the same line at the top of the /etc/pam.d/password.auth and /etc/pam.d/system.
auth fi les, just above the fi rst auth required line. (The comment at the top of these fi les says to not hand-edit them because running authconfig will destroy the edits. Unfortunately, you have to hand edit them, because authconfig won’t conf i gure this for you.)

*****

pam_tally2 doesn’t work with su.

*****

Configuring pam_faillock on AlmaLinux 8/9

*****

The pam_faillock module is already installed on any RHEL 8 or RHEL 9-type of Linux distro.

*****

Although you can enable and conf i gure pam_faillock by hand-editing the PAM conf i guration fi les, the RHEL distros provide an easier method, which is called authselect. (Note that this procedure works exactly the same for either a text-mode or GUI-type machine.)

*****

On either an AlmaLinux 8 or AlmaLinux 9 VM, view the available authselect prof i les by doing:
[donnie@localhost ~]$ sudo authselect list

*****

For now, at least, we’re only dealing with local users. So, we’ll use the minimal prof i le. View the features of this prof i le like this:
[donnie@localhost ~]$ sudo authselect list-features minimal

*****

Note that there are a lot of i

Brian Salehi, [5/3/23 10:18 AM]
ncluded features, but we’re only interested in the with-faillock feature.

*****

Enable the minimal prof i le, like this:
sudo authselect select minimal --force

*****

Af t er enabling a prof i le, we can now enable the pam_faillock module, like this:
sudo authselect enable-feature with-faillock

*****

In the /etc/security/ directory, open the faillock.conf fi le in your favorite text editor. Look for these four lines:
# silent # deny = 3 # unlock_time = 600 # even_deny_root

*****

Remove the preceding comment symbols from all four lines, and save the fi le.

*****

Create a user account for Vicky by doing:
sudo useradd vicky sudo passwd vicky

*****

Open another terminal, and have Vicky deliberately make three failed login attempts. View the results in your own terminal, like this:

*****

sudo faillock

*****

sudo faillock --reset --user vicky

*****

Configuring pam_faillock on Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04

*****

Sadly, the authselect utility isn’t available for Ubuntu, so we’ll just have to hand-edit the PAM con-f i guration fi les.

*****

Open the /etc/pam.d/common-auth fi le in your favorite text editor. At the top of the fi le, insert these two lines:
auth required pam_faillock.so preauth silent auth required pam_faillock.so authfail

*****

Open the /etc/pam.d/common-account fi le in your text editor. At the bottom of the fi le, add this line:
account required pam_faillock.so

*****

Conf i gure the /etc/security/faillock.conf fi le the same way that I showed you in Step 5 of the preceding lab for AlmaLinux.

*****

Locking user accounts

*****

Anyway, there are two utilities that you can use to temporarily lock a user account:
• usermod • passwd

*****

We can lock her account by doing:

*****

sudo usermod -L katelyn

*****

To unlock her account, just do this:
sudo usermod -U katelyn

*****

Using passwd to lock user accounts

*****

sudo passwd -l katelyn

*****

This does the same job as usermod -L, but in a slightly dif f erent manner. For one thing, passwd -l will give you some feedback about what’s going on, whereas usermod -L gives you no feedback at all.

*****

To unlock Katelyn’s account, just do this:

*****

sudo passwd -u katelyn

*****

Locking the root user account

*****

So, the fi rst thing that you want to do when you set up a cloud-based server is to create a normal user account for yourself and set it up with full sudo privileges. Then, log out of the root user account, log in to your new account, and do this:
sudo passwd -l root

*****

Setting up security banners

*****

The /etc/motd fi le will present a message banner to anyone who logs in to a system through Secure Shell. On your CentOS or AlmaLinux machine, an empty motd fi le is already there. On your Ubuntu machine, the motd fi le isn’t there, but it’s a simple matter to create one.

*****

motd stands for Message of the Day.

*****

The issue fi le, also found in the /etc directory, shows a message on the local terminal, just above the login prompt. A default issue fi le will just contain macro code that shows information about the machine. Here’s an example from an Ubuntu machine:
Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS \n \l On a Red Hat-type machine, it would look like this:
\S Kernel \r on an \m

*****

Detecting compromised passwords

*****

https://haveibeenpwned.com

*****

But think about it. Do you really want to send your production password to somebody’s website? Yeah, I thought not. Instead, let’s just send a hash value of the password. Better yet, let’s just send enough of the hash to allow the site to fi nd the password in its database, but not so much that they can fi gure out what your exact password is. We’ll do that by using the Have I Been Pwned? Application Programming Interface (API).

*****

curl https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/21BD1

*****

You’re going to get a lot of output
