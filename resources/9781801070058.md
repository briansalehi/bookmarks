<summary>Execute the CMake configuration stage?</summary>

> ```sh

<details>
<summary>Specify the generator used for building the project?</summary>

> Selecting and configuring a generator decides which build tool from our system will be used for building.
> This can be overridden by the `CMAKE_GENERATOR` environment variable or by specifying the generator directly on the command line.
>
> ```sh
> cmake -G <generator-name> <path-to-source>
> ``````

<details>
<summary>Externally specify the toolset and platform in configuration stage?</summary>

> Some generators (such as Visual Studio) support a more in-depth specification of a toolset (compiler) and platform (compiler or SDK).
> Additionally, these have respective environment variables that override the default values: `CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` and `CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`.
>
> ```sh
> cmake -G <generator-name> -T <toolset-spec> -A <platform-name>Â <path-to-source>

<summary>Prepopulate cached information by providing the initial cache script?</summary>

> We can provide a path to the CMake script, which (only) contains a list of `set()` commands to specify variables that will be used to initialize an empty build tree.
>
> ```sh
> cmake -C <initial-cache-script> <path-to-source>
> ``````

<details>
<summary>Specify cached information by providing command line arguments?</summary>

> The initialization and modification of existing cache variables can be done in command line, as follows:
>
> ```sh
> cmake -D <var>[:<type>]=<value> <path-to-source>
> ``````
>
> The `:<type>` section is optional (it is used by GUIs); you can use `BOOL`, `FILEPATH`, `PATH`, `STRING`, or `INTERNAL`.
>
> If you omit the type, it will be set to the type of an already existing variable; otherwise, it will be set to `UNINITIALIZED`.

<details>
<summary>Specify the build configuration?</summary>

> For single-configuration generators (such as Make and Ninja), you'll need to specify it during the configuration phase with the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable and generate a separate build tree for each type of config:
>
> * `Debug`
> * `Release`
> * `MinSizeRel`
> * `RelWithDebInfo`
>
> ```sh
> cmake -S . -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
> ``````
>
> Custom variables that are added manually with the `-D` option won't be visible in cache variables list unless you specify one of the supported types.

<details>
<summary>List cache variables?</summary>

> ```sh
> cmake -L[A][H] <path-to-source>
> ``````
>
> Such a list will contain cache variables that aren't marked as `ADVANCED`.
> We can change that by adding the `A` modifier.
>
> To print help messages with variables, add the `H` modifier.
>
> Custom variables that are added manually with the `-D` option won't be visible unless you specify one of the supported types.

<details>
<summary>Remove one or more cache variables?</summary>

> ```sh
> cmake -U <globbing_expr> <path-to-source>
> ``````
>
> Here, the globbing expression supports the `*` wildcard and any `?` character symbols.
> Both of the `-U` and `-D` options can be repeated multiple times.

<details>
<summary>Get general information about variables, commands, macros, and other settings?</summary>

> ```sh
cmake --system-information [file]
> ``````
>
> The optional file argument allows you to store the output in a file.
>
> Running it in the build tree directory will print additional information about the cache variables and build messages from the log files.

<details>
<summary>Filter the CMake log output by log level in the command line?</summary>

> By default, the log level is `STATUS`.
>
> ```sh
> cmake --log-level=<level>
> ``````
>
> Here, level can be any of the following:
>
> * `ERROR`
> * `WARNING`
> * `NOTICE`
> * `STATUS`
> * `VERBOSE`
> * `DEBUG`
> * `TRACE`

<details>
<summary>Permanently specify the log level in project configuration?</summary>

> You can specify this setting permanently in the `CMAKE_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL` cache variable.

> Origin: 1

> References:

</details>

<details>
<summary>Display log context with each <code>message()</code> call?</summary>

> To debug very complex projects, the `CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT` variable can be used like a stack.
> Whenever your code enters a specific context, you can add a descriptive name to the stack and remove it when leaving.
> By doing this, our messages will be decorated with the current `CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT` variable like so:
>
> ```
> [some.context.example] Debug message
> ``````
>
> The option to enable this kind of log output is as follows:
>
> ```sh
> cmake --log-context <path-to-source>
> ``````

<summary>Enable trace mode?</summary>

> If all logging options fail there is always trace mode.
>
> Trace mode will print every command with the filename and exact line number it is called from alongside its arguments.
>
> ```sh
> cmake --trace
> ``````

<summary>Where to write project presets?</summary>

> Developers can simplify how users interact with their projects and provide a `CMakePresets.json` file that specifies some defaults.

<details>
<summary>List all of the available presets?</summary>

> ```sh
> cmake --list-presets

<details>
<summary>Use one of the available presets in the project?</summary>

> ```sh
> cmake --preset=<preset>
> ``````
>
> These values override the system defaults and the environment.
> However, at the same time, they can be overridden with any arguments that are explicitly passed on the command line.

<summary>Execute the build stage of the project?</summary>

<details>
<summary>Provide special arguments to the native builder?</summary>

> CMake allows you to specify key build parameters that work for every builder.
> If you need to provide special arguments to your chosen, native builder, pass them at the end of the command after the `--` token.
>
> ```sh
> cmake --build <dir> -- <build-tool-options>
> ``````

<details>
<summary>Specify the number of jobs that should build the project simultaneously?</summary>

> Builders know the structure of project dependencies, so they can simultaneously process steps that have their dependencies met to save time.
>
> ```sh
> cmake --build <dir> --parallel [<number-of-jobs>]
> cmake --build <dir> -j [<number-of-jobs>]
> ``````
>
> The alternative is to set it with the `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL` environment variable.

<details>
<summary>Explicitly specify targets to build?</summary>

> Every project is made up of one or more parts, called targets.
> Usually, we'll want to build all of them;
> However, on occasion, we might be interested in skipping some or explicitly building a target that was deliberately excluded from normal builds.
>
> ```sh
> cmake --build <dir> --target <target1> -t <target2> ...

<summary>Remove all artifacts from the build directory?</summary>

> ```sh

> cmake --build <dir> --target clean

<summary>Execute build stage by first cleaning the build directory?</summary>

> ```sh
> cmake --build <dir> --clean-first

<details>
<summary>Instruct CMake to be verbose in build stage?</summary>

> ```sh
> cmake --build <dir> --verbose
> cmake --build <dir> -v
> ``````
>
> The same effect can be achieved by setting the `CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE` cached variable.
