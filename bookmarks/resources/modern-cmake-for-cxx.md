<summary>Specify the generator used for building the project?</summary>

> Selecting and configuring a generator decides which build tool from our
> system will be used for building. This can be overridden by the
> `CMAKE_GENERATOR` environment variable or by specifying the generator
> directly on the command line.

> ```sh

<summary>Externally specify the toolset and platform in configuration stage?</summary>

> Some generators (such as Visual Studio) support a more in-depth specification
> of a toolset (compiler) and platform (compiler or SDK). Additionally, these
> have respective environment variables that override the default values:
> `CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` and `CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`.

> cmake -G <generator-name> -T <toolset-spec> -A <platform-name>Â <path-to-source>

<summary>Prepopulate cached information by providing the initial cache script?</summary>

<summary>Specify cached information by providing command line arguments?</summary>

> The initialization and modification of existing cache variables can be done
> in command line, as follows:
>
> ```sh
> cmake -D <var>[:<type>]=<value> <path-to-source>
> ``````
>
> The `:<type>` section is optional (it is used by GUIs); you can use `BOOL`,
> `FILEPATH`, `PATH`, `STRING`, or `INTERNAL`.
>
> If you omit the type, it will be set to the type of an already existing
> variable; otherwise, it will be set to `UNINITIALIZED`.

<summary>Specify the build configuration?</summary>

> For single-configuration generators (such as Make and Ninja), you'll need to
> specify it during the configuration phase with the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`
> variable and generate a separate build tree for each type of config:
>
> * `Debug`
> * `Release`
> * `MinSizeRel`
> * `RelWithDebInfo`
>
> ```sh
> cmake -S . -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
> ``````
>
> Custom variables that are added manually with the `-D` option won't be
> visible in cache variables list unless you specify one of the supported
> types.

<details>
<summary>List cache variables?</summary>

> ```sh
> cmake -L[A][H] <path-to-source>
> ``````
>
> Such a list will contain cache variables that aren't marked as `ADVANCED`. We
> can change that by adding the `A` modifier.
>
> To print help messages with variables, add the `H` modifier.
>
> Custom variables that are added manually with the `-D` option won't be
> visible unless you specify one of the supported types.

<summary>Remove one or more cache variables?</summary>

> ```sh
> cmake -U <globbing_expr> <path-to-source>
> ``````
>
> Here, the globbing expression supports the `*` wildcard and any `?` character
> symbols. Both of the `-U` and `-D` options can be repeated multiple times.

<summary>Get general information about variables, commands, macros, and other settings?</summary>

> ```sh
cmake --system-information [file]
> ``````
>
> The optional file argument allows you to store the output in a file.
>
> Running it in the build tree directory will print additional information
> about the cache variables and build messages from the log files.

<summary>Filter the CMake log output by log level in the command line?</summary>

> By default, the log level is `STATUS`.
>
> ```sh

> * `ERROR`
> * `WARNING`

<summary>Display log context with each <code>message()</code> call?</summary>

> To debug very complex projects, the `CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT` variable can be
> used like a stack. Whenever your code enters a specific context, you can add
> a descriptive name to the stack and remove it when leaving. By doing this,
> our messages will be decorated with the current `CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT`
> variable like so:

<summary>Explicitly specify targets to build?</summary>

<summary>Include another listfile in `CMakeLists.txt`?</summary>

>
> CMake projects are configured with `CMakeLists.txt` listfiles.

<summary>What are the actual requirements for the script file provided?</summary>

> Not that many: a script can be as complex as you like or an empty file.
> However, it is recommended that you call the `cmake_minimum_required()`
> command at the beginning of the script. This command tells CMake which
> policies should be applied to subsequent commands in this project
>
> When running scripts, CMake won't execute any of the usual stages (such as
> configuration or generation), and it won't use the cache.

<summary>What preset paths are available in scripts?</summary>

> Since there is no concept of a source/build tree in scripts, variables that
> usually hold references to these paths will contain the current working
> directory instead: `CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`, `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`,
> `CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`, and `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`.
