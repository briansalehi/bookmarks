<summary><b>ACID</b> stands for <b>Atomicity</b>, <b>Consistency</b>, <b>Isolation</b>, and <b>Durability</b>.</summary>

> - **Atomicity**: Complex database operations is proccessed as a single instruction.
> - **Consistency**: Data within the database will not be corrupted due to partially performed operations.
> - **Isolation**: Allows database to handle concurrency, without interleaved changes.
> - **Durability**: Database engine is supposed to protect the data it contains, even in the case of software and hardware failures.

<summary>A <b>PostgreSQL</b> instance is called a <b>cluster</b> because a single instance can serve and handle multiple databases.</summary>

<summary>A database can be organized into namespaces, called <b>schemas</b>.</summary>

<summary>Database <b>objects</b> are represented by everything the user can create and manage within the database; for instance, tables, functions, triggers, and data types.</summary>

<summary>Every <b>object</b> belongs to one and only one schema that, if not specified, is the default <b>public</b> schema.</summary>

<summary>Users are defined at a cluster-wide level, which means they are not tied to a particular database in the cluster.</summary>

<summary><b>PostgreSQL</b> has two user categories: <b>normal users</b> who can connect to and handle databases and objects, and <b>superusers</b> who can do anything with any database object.</summary>

<summary>PostgreSQL allows the configuration of as many superusers as you need, and every superuser has the very same permissions.</summary>

<summary>PostgreSQL internal data, such as users, databases, namespaces, configuration, and database runtime status, is provided by means of catalogs, which are special tables that present information in a SQL-interactive way.</summary>

<summary>PostgreSQL stores all of its content in a single filesystem directory known as <code>PGDATA</code>.</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>The <code>PGDATA</code> directory represents what the cluster is serving as databases, and it consists of at least the write-ahead logs (WALs) and the data storage.</summary>

<summary>It is possible to have a single installation of <b>PostgreSQL</b> and make it switch to different <code>PGDATA</code> directories to deliver different content.</summary>

<details>
<summary>The <code>PGDATA</code> directory needs to be initialized by creation of the directory structure within it before it can be used by <b>PostgreSQL</b>.</summary>

<summary>The first single process of PostgreSQL is <code>postmaster</code> which waits for incoming client connections.</summary>

<summary>The <code>postmaster</code> process forks <code>backend processes</code> which each of them serve one and only one connection.</summary>

<summary>Steps to build <b>PostgreSQL</b> from source are as follows:</summary>

> First build the project:
> 
> ```sh
> git clone https://github.com/postgresql/postgresql
> cd postgresql
> git checkout <latest>
> ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
> make
> sudo make install
> ``````
> 
> Create postgres user and initialize database:
> 
> ```sh
> sudo useradd postgres
> sudo mkdir /opt/postgres/14
> sudo chown postgres:postgres /opt/postgres/14
> initdb -D /opt/postgresql/14
> ``````

<summary>Steps to build PostgreSQL using pgenv are as follows:</summary>

> Prepare script:
> 
> ```sh
> git clone https://github.com/theory/pgenv
> cp pgenv/bin/pgenv ~/.local/bin/
> ``````
> 
> Build database:
> 
> ```sh
> pgenv available
> pgenv build <version>
> ``````
