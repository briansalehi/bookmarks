<summary>What is the objective of <b>I/O service</b> in boost?</summary>

> The I/O service is a channel that is used to access operating system resources and establish communication between our program and the operating system that performs I/O requests.

<summary>What is the objective of <b>I/O object</b> in boost?</summary>

> The I/O object has the role of submitting I/O requests.
> For instance, the `tcp::socket` object will provide a socket programming request from our program to the operating system.

<summary>Start the event processing loop of an I/O service object without assigning works to it?</summary>

> Running the `io_service` object's event processing loop will block the execution of the program and will run ready

<summary>Start the event processing loop of an I/O service object without blocking execution?</summary>

> The `poll()` function will run the `io_service` object's event processing loop without blocking the execution of the program.
> This will run the handlers until there are no more ready handlers remaining or until the `io_service` object has been stopped.
