<summary>What is a good starting step to learn writing a simple platform driver?</summary>

> Write a platform driver, register it with the kernel's `misc` framework and
> the **platform bus**, a pseudo-bus infrastructure that supports devices that
> do not physically reside on any physical bus. Several peripherals built into
> a modern **SoC** are not on any physical bus, and thus their drivers are
> typically platform drivers. To get started, look under the kernel source tree
> in `drivers/` for code invoking the `platform_driver_register()` API.

<summary>What distinguishes device classes in the kernel?</summary>

> In order for the kernel to distinguish between device files, it uses two
> attributes within their inode data structure:
>
> - The type of file – either char or block
> - The major and minor number
>
> The key difference between block and character devices is that block devices
> have the kernel-level capability to be mounted and thus become part of the
> user-accessible filesystem. Character devices cannot be mounted.
>
> From 2.6 Linux onward, the `{major:minor}` pair is a single unsigned 32-bit
> quantity within the inode, a bitmask (it's the `dev_t i_rdev` member). Of
> these 32 bits, the MSB 12 bits represent the major number and the remaining
> LSB 20 bits represent the minor number.
>
> Only **Linux Assigned Names And Numbers Authority (LANANA)** can officially
> assign the device node (the type and `major:minor` numbers) to devices
>
> The minor number's meaning (interpretation) is left completely to the driver
> author; the kernel does not interfere.
>
> Here, the exception to the rule - that the kernel doesn't interpret the minor
> number – is the `misc` class (type character, major `#10`). It uses the minor
> numbers as second-level majors.
>
> A common problem is that of the namespace getting exhausted. Within the misc
> class (`#10`) live a lot of devices and their corresponding drivers. In
> effect, they share the same major number and rely on a unique minor number to
> identify themselves.

<summary>Propegate unsupported file operation error from kernel driver to user space proces?</summary>

> An appropriate value to return if you aren't supporting a function is `-ENOSYS`, which will have the user-mode process see the error `Function not implemented`.

<summary>What is the entry point of device drivers?</summary>

> A device driver is the interface between the OS and a peripheral hardware
> device. It can be written inline and compiled within the kernel image file or
> written outside of the kernel source tree as a kernel module.
>
> A device driver provides several entry points into the kernel known as the
> driver's methods. All possible methods the driver author can hook into are in
> `file_operations` kernel data structure defined in `include/linux/fs.h`
> header file.
>
> `device file`, or `device node` files typically live in the `/dev` directory,
> and on modern systems are dynamic and auto-populated. The device node serves
> as an entry point into the device driver.

<summary>Assign file operations on a misc driver?</summary>

> The `file_operations` structure represents all possible `file_related` system
> calls that could be issued on a device file including `open`, `read`, `poll`,
> `mmap`, `release`, and several more members.
>
> Once your driver is registered with the kernel, when any user space process
> opens a device file registered to this driver, the kernel **Virtual
> Filesystem Switch (VFS)** layer will take over to allocate and initialize
> that process's open file data structure (`struct file`) for the device file.

>     .write = write_miscdev,

<summary>Where do device drivers should reside in the kernel?</summary>

> From the 2.6 kernel onward, the unified **Linux Device Model (LDM)** that
> among its many features, it creates a complex, hierarchical tree exposed to
> user space via the sysfs pseudo-filesystem and is typically mounted under
> `/sys` containing several directories that can be considered viewports into
> the LDM. A fundamental LDM tenet is that *every single device must reside on
> a bus* where buses are located in `/sys/bus` directory.

<summary>Implement file operation functions in device driver?</summary>
