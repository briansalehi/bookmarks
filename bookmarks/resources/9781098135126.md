<details>
<summary>How does <code>eBPF</code> help us to learn application behavior?</summary>

> With `eBPF` we can add instrumentation into the kernel to observe application interactions with the kernel and intercept what would be involved if we wanted to modify the kernel, adding new code to create some kind of output whenever that system call is invoked.

<summary>What does the <code>eBPF</code> verifier?</summary>

> The `eBPF` verifier, which ensures that an eBPF program is loaded only if it’s safe to run—it won’t crash the machine or lock it up in a hard loop, and it won’t allow data to be compromised.

<summary>What is the advantage of dynamic loading functionality in <code>eBPF</code>?</summary>

> `eBPF` programs can be loaded into and removed from the kernel dynamically.
> Once they are attached to an event, they’ll be triggered by that event regardless of what caused that event to occur.
> This is a huge advantage compared to upgrading the kernel and then having to reboot the machine to use its new functionality.

<summary>How efficient is loading <code>eBPF</code> programs?</summary>

> Once loaded and JIT-compiled, the program runs as native machine instructions on the CPU.
> Additionally, there’s no need to incur the cost of transitioning between kernel and user space (which is an expensive operation) to handle each event.

<summary>How to load a simple <code>eBPF</code> code in python's BCC library as a simplified example?</summary>

> ```py
> #!/usr/bin/python3
>
> from bcc import BPF
>
> program = r"""
> int sample(void *ctx)
> {
>     bpf_trace_printk("Sample BPF");
>     return 0;
> }
> """
>
> try:
>     b = BPF(text = program)
>     syscall = b.get_syscall_fnname("execve")
>     b.attach_kprobe(event = syscall, fn_name = "sample")
>     b.trace_print()
> except KeyboardInterrupt as e:
>     print()
>     exit()
> ``````
>
> The entire `eBPF` program is defined as a string called `program` and is compiled in the constructor of `BPF` class.
>
> `eBPF` programs need to be attached to an event, which in this case it is attached to the system call `execve`, which is the syscall used to execute a program.
> Whenever anything or anyone starts a new program executing on this machine, that will call `execve()`, which will trigger the `eBPF` program.
>
> Although the `execve()` name is a standard interface in Linux, the name of the function that implements it in the kernel depends on the chip architecture, but BCC gives us a convenient way to look up the function name for the machine we’re running on:
>
>
> ```py
> syscall = b.get_syscall_fnname("execve")
> ``````
>
> Now, syscall represents the name of the kernel function that is going to attach to, using a kprobe:
>
> ```py
> b.attach_kprobe(event=syscall, fn_name="hello")
> ``````
>
> At this point, the `eBPF` program is loaded into the kernel and attached to an event, so the program will be triggered whenever a new executable gets launched on the machine.
>
> The tracing function will loop indefinitely, displaying any trace:
>
> ```py
> b.trace_print()
> ``````

<summary>What capabilities are required for eBPF programs to run?</summary>

> `CAP_PERFMON` and `CAP_BPF` are both required to load tracing programs.
> `CAP_NET_ADMIN` and `CAP_BPF` are both required for loading networking programs.

<summary>Where does the <code>eBPF</code> trace printing function write output?</summary>

> The `bpf_trace_printk()` helper function in the kernel always sends output to the same predefined pseudofile `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe`.
>
> You’ll need root privileges to access it.
