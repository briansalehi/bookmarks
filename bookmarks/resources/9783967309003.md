<summary>What happens to an object when move semantics is not available?</summary>

> The rule is that for a temporary object or an object marked with

<summary>What happens to an object declared with <code>const</code> when moved?</summary>

> The function taking the string by value will use move semantics because a new

> Move semantics does not guarantee that any optimization happens at all or

<summary>Why should we avoid using <code>std::move</code> when returning a local object?</summary>

> Returning a local object by value automatically uses move semantics if

> rvalue reference, therefore disables **return value optimization**, which
> usually allows the returned object to be used as a return value instead.

<summary>Why <i>strong exception handling guarantee</i> is required for <code>std::vector</code> to use move operations instead of copying objects?</summary>

> When an exception is thrown in the middle of the reallocation of the vector
> the C++ standard library guarantees to roll back the vector to its previous
> state. However, when using move semantics if an exception is thrown during
> the reallocation, we might not be able to roll back. The elements in the new
> memory have already stolen the values of the elements in the old memory. The
> final decision was to use move semantics on reallocation only when the move
> constructor of the element types guarantees not to throw.
