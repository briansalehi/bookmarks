Docker allocates the private subnet from an unused RFC 1918 private subnet
block. It detects which network blocks are unused on the host and allocates one
of those to the virtual network. That is bridged to the hostâ€™s local network
through an interface on the server called `docker0`. This means that, by
default, all of the containers are on a network together and can talk to each
other directly. But to get to the host or the outside world, they go over the
`docker0` virtual bridge interface.
