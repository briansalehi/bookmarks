<summary>What image channels are affected by drawing functions?</summary>

> Drawing functions work with images of any depth, but most of them affect only
> the first three channels defaulting to only the first channel in the case of
> single channel images. They also support a color, thickness, a line type, and
> subpixel alignment of objects.

<summary>What data type is used to specify color by convention?</summary>

> The convention is to use `cv::Scalar` object to specify color.
>
> Only the first three values are used most of the time eventhough it is
> convinient to use the fourth value to represent an alpha channel, but drawing
> functions do not currently support alpha bending.
>
> By convention, OpenCV uses BGR ordering for converting multichannel images to
> color renderings. In any case, the core functions of the library are always
> agnostic to any "meaning" you might assign to a channel.
