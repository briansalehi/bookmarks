<summary>What is the general form of each line of sudo rules and what is the definition and scope of each part?</summary>

> `username` might also be a system group, or an alias defined within sudoers.
> `host` is the hostname of the system that this rule applies to when sudoers file is shared across multiple systems.
> `command` lists the full path to each command this rule applies to.
> `ALL` matches every possible option for each of these parts.

<details>
<summary>Why is it best practice to specify a specific <code>hostname</code> rather than <code>ALL</code> in sudo rules?</summary>

> Most commonly ALL is ste as `host` because most system administrators configure sudo on per-host basis.
> Separately managing every server and defining the server as `ALL` means "this server", but it's best practice to put the server name as `host`.
