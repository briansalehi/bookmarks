<summary>Why $y^2 = x^2$ is not a function?</summary>

> A function $f$ from a set $D$ to a set $Y$ is a rule that assigns a unique value $f(x)$ in $Y$ to each $x$ in $D$.
>
> The value of one variable quantity, say $y$, depends on the value of another variable quantity, which we often call $x$.
> We say that $y$ is a function of $x$ and write this symbolically as
>
> $y = f(x)$ ($y$ equals $f$ of $x$)
>
> The symbol $f$ represents the function, the letter $x$ is the **independent variable** representing the input value to $f$, and $y$ is the **dependent variable** or ouput value of $f$ at $x$.

<summary>What is the vertical line test?</summary>

> A function $f$ can have only one value $f(x)$ for each $x$ in its domain, so no vertical line can interact the graph of a function more than once.

<summary>What is an increasing or decreasing function?</summary>

> If the graph of a function rises as you move from left to right, we say that the function is increasing.
> If the graph descends or falls as you move from left to right, the function is decreasing.
>
> Let $f$ be a function defined on an interval $I$ and let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be two distinct points in $I$.
>
> 1. if $f(x_2) > f(x_1)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x)$ is said to be **increasing** on $I$.
> 2. if $f(x_2) < f(x_1)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x)$ is said to be **decreasing** on $I$.

> A function $y = f(x)$ is an even function of $x$ if $f(-x) = f(x)$, odd function of $x$ if $f(-x) = -f(x)$, for every $x$ in the function's domain.

<summary>When two variables become proportional to each other?</summary>

> Two variables $y$ and $x$ are **proportional** to one another if one is always a constant multiple of the other.

> $y = kx$ for some nonzero constant $k$
>
> If the variable $y$ is proportional to the reciprocal $1/x$, then it is said that $y$ is **inversely proportional** to $x$.
